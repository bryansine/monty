c - stacks, Queues - LIFO,FIFO TASKS
In computer science and data structures, "LIFO" stands for "Last In, First Out," and it is typically associated with stacks. In a stack, the last element added is the first one to be removed.On the other hand, "FIFO" stands for "First In, First Out," and it is commonly associated with queues. In a queue, the first element added is the first one to be removed, which follows a linear order.Both stacks and queues are abstract data types used to organize and manage collections of data, and they have various applications in programming and computer science.
Stacks (LIFO - Last In, First Out):A stack is a data structure that follows the LIFO principle.Imagine it as a stack of plates – the last plate placed on top is the first one you can remove.Operations on a stack are typically limited to two main actions: "push" (to add an item to the top of the stack) and "pop" (to remove the item from the top).Stacks are used in various scenarios, such as function call management (call stack), undo mechanisms, and expression evaluation.
Queues (FIFO - First In, First Out):A queue is a data structure that adheres to the FIFO principle.Think of it as a line of people – the person who arrives first is the first one to be served.The primary operations on a queue are "enqueue" (to add an item to the back of the queue) and "dequeue" (to remove the item from the front).
